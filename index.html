It was very worst service from Amazon I have ever known. If there is an option, I would have given minus infinity rating for Amazon service. 
<br><br>
I purchased IFB washing machine from Amazon.in and during installation, it was found its motor is faulty. During return we forgot to remove water filter we installed along with it worth INR 1850. 
<br><br>
When I called Amazon customer care, I was promised once it reaches back fullfillment center, the resolution will be either to return it back to me or credit me the equivalent amount. But after the product reached fullfillment center, now I am informed nothing can be done in this matter. 
<br><br>
Also, the Amazon customer representative dropped the call with the inability to answer my questions apart from the words sorry & impossible.
<br><br>
Amazon is not ready to return the water filter or credit the amount. Amazon is full of false promises. After becoming big player in the market, I think something has got in their heads. 
<br><br>
If Amazon continues like this kind of customer handling approach it will face huge surge and lose its market. Just because they sent faulty product, I lost additional money. 
<br><br>
I should have become aware when already few customers warned of Amazon selling faulty products in product reviews. But I was blind to choose Amazon and now I am facing consequences. 
<br><br>
I will request everyone in the planet to be aware and not to buy any product in Amazon platform by creating an online campaign.
<br><br>
We made Amazon wealthiest but it simply doesn't meet customer expectations. Then, what is the point of doing business?
<br><br>
Now I am able to conclude how Amazon boss was able to become the planet's wealthiest person.
